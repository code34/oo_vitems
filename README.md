# oo_vitems

Virtual Items is an OOP Class which allows to manage virtual inventories in ARMA. This class supports inventory management for all 3D objects in the game.

This class creates containers with properties that will contain virtual objects with properties. The containers are attached to the 3D objects of the game.

Properties for the containers are:
- size
- the weight

Properties for objects are:
- the price
- size
- the weight
- the owner
- the description
- durability

These properties can be easily modified, which allows to add very elaborate features to the games. Objects do not require 3d modeling.
